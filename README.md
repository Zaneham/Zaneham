# G'day, Kia Ora, and... Hello

I'm Zane. I write software for computers that no longer exist, languages that probably shouldn't, and occasionally something useful by accident.

Some of this works. Some of it is a work in progress. All of it is being built in public because waiting until things are "ready" is how projects die in private folders.

The Projects below are in various states of completion and will be worked on from time to time. You're more than welcome to reach out if you use one something I've made and are encountering a problem. 
Some projects are just 'as is' because no one will be updating the Flow-matic standards anytime soon.

## What I Do (Allegedly)

### Language Server Protocols for Languages Your Nan Used

Because someone has to maintain IDE support for programming languages older than most democracies:

- **[hals-lsp](https://github.com/Zaneham/hals-lsp)** - Space Shuttle programming, minus the shuttle
- **[jovial-lsp](https://github.com/Zaneham/jovial-lsp)** - For when the US Air Force needs syntax highlighting
- **[cms2-lsp](https://github.com/Zaneham/cms2-lsp)** - US Navy's finest, now with autocomplete
- **[coral66-lsp](https://github.com/Zaneham/coral66-lsp)** - British military computing, as God intended
- **[chill-lsp](https://github.com/Zaneham/chill-lsp)** - ITU telecom standard. We are also pretty Chill
- **[os360-lsp](https://github.com/Zaneham/os360-lsp)** - COBOL F, PL/I F, and HLASM for the discerning mainframe enthusiast
- **[mumps-lsp](https://github.com/Zaneham/mumps-lsp)** - Yes, MUMPS. Yes, it's real. Yes, your hospital probably runs on it
- **[racf-lsp](https://github.com/Zaneham/racf-lsp)** - IBM mainframe security. Building in public. Does not work yet

### Transpilers and Compilers (Why Not)

- **[chill-compiler](https://github.com/Zaneham/chill-compiler)** - CHILL to C transpiler. Because someone asked "but can it run on modern hardware"
- **[jovial-compiler](https://github.com/Zaneham/jovial-compiler).** - A real Jovial Compiler, for the discerning military aviation enthusiast with opinions on memory safety.

### Emulators for Questionable Hardware

- **[z390](https://github.com/z390development/z390)** - IBM Mainframe emulator (contributor). Come and enjoy the wonderful world of the mainframe
- **[voyager-fds-emulator](https://github.com/Zaneham/voyager-fds-emulator)** - Voyager Flight Data Subsystem. The computer that's leaving the solar system
- **[minuteman-computer-emulator](https://github.com/Zaneham/minuteman-computer-emulator)** - ICBM guidance computer. I'm probably on a list now
- **[setun70-emulator](https://github.com/Zaneham/setun70-emulator)** - Soviet ternary computer. Because binary is for capitalists
- **[viking-marsrover-emulator](https://github.com/Zaneham/viking-marsrover-emulator)** - 1970s Mars lander. 40KB of RAM. Absolute unit

### Fortran Modernisation (Not an Oxymoron)

Keeping scientific computing alive, one 50-year-old numerical library at a time:

- **[SLATEC](https://github.com/Zaneham/SLATEC)** - Modernising the SLATEC library for modern Fortran
- **[SLATEC.jl](https://github.com/Zaneham/SLATEC.jl)** - Julia port of SLATEC. Work in progress
- **[dcuhre](https://github.com/Zaneham/dcuhre)** - Multi-dimensional adaptive integration. Riveting stuff
- **[odepackzane](https://github.com/Zaneham/odepackzane)** - ODE solvers, now with fewer punch cards

### Historic Languages (Not Dead, Just Resting)

- **[plankalkuel](https://github.com/Zaneham/plankalkuel)** - Zuse's 1948 programming language. Hipster computing before it was cool
- **[flow-matic](https://github.com/Zaneham/flow-matic)** - Grace Hopper's business language. COBOL's mum, basically
- **[zuse-chess-1942](https://github.com/Zaneham/zuse-chess-1942)** - Chess in Plankalkuel. Historically accurate existential dread included

### Other Bits

- **[conway](https://github.com/Zaneham/conway)** - RISC-V to x86-64 binary translator. Written in assembly. Passes RISC-V committee compliance tests.
  Translates things.
- **[wu](https://github.com/Zaneham/wu)** - Media forensics toolkit. For legal teams. Very serious
- **[nistcobol85](https://github.com/Zaneham/nistcobol85)** - NIST COBOL 85 test suite. 11,000 test cases of pure joy
