# G'day, Kia Ora, and... Hello

I'm Zane. I build tooling for historical and legacy computing systems, working from original specifications and primary source documentation. Compilers, emulators, language servers, and numerical libraries - mostly for systems that still run critical infrastructure but haven't had new tooling in decades.

Some of this is preservation. Some of it is practical. All of it is built in public because waiting until things are "ready" is how projects die in private folders.

The projects below are in various states of completion and will be worked on from time to time. You're more than welcome to reach out if you use something I've made and are encountering a problem. Some projects are just 'as is' because no one will be updating the FLOW-MATIC standards anytime soon.

## What I Do (Allegedly)

### Language Server Protocols for Languages Your Nan Used

Because someone has to maintain IDE support for programming languages older than most democracies:

- **[hals-lsp](https://github.com/Zaneham/hals-lsp)** - Space Shuttle programming, minus the shuttle
- **[jovial-lsp](https://github.com/Zaneham/jovial-lsp)** - For when the US Air Force needs syntax highlighting
- **[cms2-lsp](https://github.com/Zaneham/cms2-lsp)** - US Navy's finest, now with autocomplete
- **[coral66-lsp](https://github.com/Zaneham/coral66-lsp)** - British military computing, as God intended
- **[chill-lsp](https://github.com/Zaneham/chill-lsp)** - ITU telecom standard. We are also pretty Chill
- **[IBM-system-360-lsp]([https://github.com/Zaneham/IBM-system360-LSP])** - COBOL F, PL/I F, and HLASM for the discerning mainframe enthusiast
- **[mumps-lsp](https://github.com/Zaneham/mumps-lsp)** - Yes, MUMPS. Yes, it's real. Yes, your hospital probably runs on it
- **[racf-lsp](https://github.com/Zaneham/racf-lsp)** - IBM mainframe security. In development

### Compilers and Translators

- **[conway](https://github.com/Zaneham/conway)** - RISC-V to x86-64 binary translator. Written in assembly
- **[plankalkul-compiler](https://github.com/Zaneham/plankalkul-compiler)** - OCaml compiler for Zuse's 1945 Plankalkül. 2D notation, all 7 loop variants, chess programs from the original manuscripts
- **[chill-compiler](https://github.com/Zaneham/chill-compiler)** - CHILL to C transpiler. Because someone asked "but can it run on modern hardware"
- **[jovial-compiler](https://github.com/Zaneham/jovial-compiler)** - MIL-STD-1589C compliant JOVIAL compiler. Built from the original military specification

### Emulators for Questionable Hardware

- **[z390](https://github.com/z390development/z390)** - IBM Mainframe emulator (core contributor). Come and enjoy the wonderful world of the mainframe
- **[voyager-fds-emulator](https://github.com/Zaneham/voyager-fds-emulator)** - Voyager Flight Data Subsystem. The computer that's leaving the solar system
- **[minuteman-computer-emulator](https://github.com/Zaneham/minuteman-computer-emulator)** - ICBM guidance computer. I'm probably on a list now
- **[setun70-emulator](https://github.com/Zaneham/setun70-emulator)** - Soviet ternary computer. Because binary is for capitalists
- **[viking-marsrover-emulator](https://github.com/Zaneham/viking-marsrover-emulator)** - 1970s Mars lander. 40KB of RAM. Absolute unit

### Fortran Modernisation (Not an Oxymoron)

Keeping scientific computing alive, one 50-year-old numerical library at a time:

- **[SLATEC](https://github.com/Zaneham/SLATEC)** - Modernising the SLATEC library for modern Fortran
- **[SLATEC.jl](https://github.com/Zaneham/SLATEC.jl)** - Julia port of SLATEC. Work in progress
- **[dcuhre](https://github.com/Zaneham/dcuhre)** - Multi-dimensional adaptive integration. Riveting stuff
- **[odepackzane](https://github.com/Zaneham/odepackzane)** - ODE solvers, now with fewer punch cards

### Historical Languages (Not Dead, Just Resting)

- **[plankalkul-ide](https://github.com/Zaneham/plankalkul-ide)** - VS Code extension for Plankalkül with 2D grid editor. **[On the Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zaneham.plankalkul)**
- **[plankalkuel](https://github.com/Zaneham/plankalkuel)** - Python interpreter for Plankalkül. The prototype that started this
- **[flow-matic](https://github.com/Zaneham/flow-matic)** - Grace Hopper's business language. COBOL's mum, basically

### Other Bits

- **[wu](https://github.com/Zaneham/wu)** - Media forensics toolkit. For legal and institutional teams
- **[nistcobol85](https://github.com/z390development/nistcobol85)** - NIST COBOL 85 test suite. 11,000 test cases of pure joy
