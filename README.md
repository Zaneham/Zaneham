# G'day, Kia Ora, and... Hello

I'm Zane. I write software for computers that no longer exist, languages that probably shouldn't, and occasionally something useful by accident.

## What I Do (Allegedly)

### Language Server Protocols for Languages Your Nan Used

Because someone has to maintain IDE support for programming languages older than most democracies:

- **[Jovial-LSP](https://github.com/Zaneham/Jovial-LSP)** - For when the US military needs syntax highlighting
- **[CMS-2-LSP](https://github.com/Zaneham/CMS-2-LSP)** - US Navy's finest, now with autocomplete
- **[Coral66-LSP](https://github.com/Zaneham/Coral66-LSP)** - British military computing, as God intended
- **[Chill-lsp](https://github.com/Zaneham/Chill-lsp)** - We are also pretty Chill
- **[HALS-LSP](https://github.com/Zaneham/hals-lsp)** - Space Shuttle programming, minus the shuttle
- **[IBM-system360-LSP](https://github.com/Zaneham/IBM-system360-LSP)** - COBOL F and PL/I F, for the discerning mainframe enthusiast
- **[mumps-lsp](https://github.com/Zaneham/mumps-lsp)** - Yes, MUMPS. Yes, it's real. Yes, your hospital probably runs on it.

### Emulators for Questionable Hardware

- **[z390](https://github.com/Zaneham/z390Zane)** - IBM Mainframe emulator. The 1960s called, they want their batch processing back
- **[Minuteman-computer-emulator](https://github.com/Zaneham/Minuteman-computer-emulator)** - Hooray! A missile guidance computer emulator! (I'm probably on a list now)
- **[setun70-emulator](https://github.com/Zaneham/setun70-emulator)** - Soviet ternary computer. Because binary is for capitalists
- **[Viking-Marsrover-emulator](https://github.com/Zaneham/Viking-Marsrover-emulator)** - 1970s Mars rover. 40KB of RAM. Absolute unit.

### Fortran Modernisation (Not an Oxymoron)

Keeping scientific computing alive, one 50-year-old numerical library at a time:

- **[SLATEC](https://github.com/Zaneham/SLATEC)** - Modernising the SLATEC library. It has 16 stars. I'm basically famous
- **[dcuhre](https://github.com/Zaneham/dcuhre)** - Multi-dimensional adaptive integration. Riveting stuff
- **[odepackzane](https://github.com/Zaneham/odepackzane)** - ODE solvers, now with fewer punch cards

### Historic Languages (Not Dead, Just Resting)

- **[Plankalkuel](https://github.com/Zaneham/Plankalkuel)** - Zuse's 1948 programming language. Hipster computing before it was cool
- **[Flow-matic](https://github.com/Zaneham/Flow-matic)** - Grace Hopper's business language. COBOL's mum, basically
- **[zuse-chess-1942](https://github.com/Zaneham/zuse-chess-1942)** - Chess like it's 1941. Historically accurate existential dread included

### Other Bits

- **[Conway](https://github.com/Zaneham/Conway)** - RISC-V and x86 binary translator. It translates things.
- **[Wu](https://github.com/Zaneham/Wu)** - Media forensics toolkit. For legal teams. Very serious.
- **[nistcobol85](https://github.com/Zaneham/nistcobol85)** - NIST COBOL 85 test suite. 11,000 test cases of pure joy

## Tech Stack

```
Languages I Actually Use: Python, C, Fortran, Java, Julia
Languages I Keep Alive Out of Spite: COBOL, JOVIAL, CMS-2, Coral 66, CHILL, MUMPS, PL/I, HLASM

Regrets: Several

## Contact

Based somewhere between New Zealand and the 1970s.

If you need an LSP for a language the Geneva Convention forgot to ban, I'm probably your person.
